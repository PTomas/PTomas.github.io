  <p><b>Now We're Talking<b><p>
      <p>Now We’re Talking allows users to communicate about changes in their government by pulling acts publicly<p/>
      <p>posted by the senate and facilitating the online debate process. To do this Now We’re Talking allows <p>
      <p>users to view issues/legislation in scrolling cells on the topics page. Once an item is clicked the <p>
      <p>user shall be able to agree or disagree with the issue. Upon making a decision users are then placed <p>
      <p>into groups of 10 for debate where they can link articles from the scrolling link view(horizontal) in<p>
      <p>the message board area for the discussions page. The groups shall be placed in is balanced by the<p>
      <p>percentage of total users that agree or disagree ie. if 50% agree the ratio should be 5-5 and so on.<p>
      <p>In this way, users shall be able to act as representatives of their opinion in a real debate setting. <p>
      <p>each time a user is convinced to change opinions (using the opinion buttons also located on the discussion<p>
      <p>page) users in that group are placed into a new group still balanced by the percentage of total user <p>
      <p>opinions. topics shall be able to be favourited on the discussion page as well. Once tagged as a favourite<p>
      <p>the topic shall appear on the favourites page. A graph of total user opinions on that topic(highlighted)<p>
      <p>as well as others shall also be available upon clicking the title on the graphs page.<p>

      <p>This is a project still in progress aimed at allowing users to find realestate from estate sellers in a more personal</p> 
      <p> way with a lot less of the fees charged by realtors. While the full website is not ready for release the UI can be</p>

  <p><b>Efficiant Quadripeadal Motion(stranBeast)</b></p> 
      <p>This project which took place my freshman year of engineering was paryt of an assignment I had for a projects class </p>
      <p>in which we were instructed to make an efficiant transportation mechanism that would carry a mass. Through careful </p>
      </p>calculation our team designed a quadripeadal walking contraption on solidworks, lasercut the required chassis</p>
      </p>componants, and prototyped a circuit board to play music for a set amount of time as well as making it walk.</p>
